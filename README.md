# Steam Account Manager

Makes smurfing a breeze.

Edits steam's keys in the Windows registry to avoid using authenticator for every account.

Future features:
- Automatically use a password on login when the account is not registered on the computer
- Use [FormatMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-formatmessage) for handling registry errors
- Terminal to remain open on error
